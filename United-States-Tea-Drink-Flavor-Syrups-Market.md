These locations use tea drink flavor syrups to create customized, fresh, and unique drink experiences for their customers. The variety of flavors available, ranging from fruity notes to more exotic blends, allows businesses to cater to a wide array of consumer tastes.

This segment benefits from consumer demand for ready-to-consume, refreshing, and easily accessible beverages, making it a popular choice for individuals seeking convenience without compromising on flavor variety.
